This is a repo I use to collect and comment web templates for beginners (as i am a beginner in the field).

- Tribute Page: a very basic page. The HTML is at [here](templates/tribute%20page/index.html) and the web view is at [here](https://codepen.io/tautaus/full/dyOvPoR).
- Survey Form: a survey form with interaction blocks. The HTML is at [here](templates/survey%20form/index.html) and the web view is at [here](https://codepen.io/tautaus/full/qBqrEdR).
  - The js backend is unfinished.
- Documentation Page: a documentation for JS, navigation bar that could adjust position depending on the screen width. The HTML is at [here](templates/documentation/index.html) and the web view is at [here](https://codepen.io/tautaus/full/NWbpLbe).
